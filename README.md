## D. Share obstacles, problems & solutions 
I've designed to create test scripts at first, but I've stuck with some point.
   1. I got business requirements with petty of detials. So, I decided to test based on positive cases what users can do for get the jobs done! It would be better If I have more details of how application works. ie. validation, logic, data
   2. Automated test needs specific expected results. So, I have to manual some functions. For example ...
      1. Signup Gmail before signup Fastwork because Google needs multi-factor verification.
      2. Search function. I have no idea how application works. This function gets varity of data. I decided just to list the simple cases which user may do.

In conclusion, Iâ€™m not so confidence if I must do black-box testing. I would appreciate more specific requirements which I can identify expected results. (No guess)

Looking forward to discuss more details.
Thank you
